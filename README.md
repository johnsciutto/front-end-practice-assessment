# Front End Practice Assessment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Requirements

This application uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get weather data. In order to run this app, you'll need an API key. These are provided for free by creating an account at the [Open Weather Map website](https://openweathermap.org/).

Once you have an API key, add the key as the value for the variable `REACT_APP_API_KEY` in the `.env` located in the root directory of the project:

```text
REACT_APP_API_KEY="your_api_key_goes_here"
```

## Running the App

To run the app in your local environment the command is `npm start`.
