# Front End Practice Assessment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Requirements

This application uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get weather data. In order to
run this app, you'll need an API key. These are provided for free by creating
an account at the [Open Weather Map website](https://openweathermap.org/).

Once you have an API key, create a `.env` file in the root directory of the
project and add a variable called `REACT_APP_API_KEY` with a value of the API
key you created with your [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/)
account:

```text
REACT_APP_API_KEY="your_api_key_goes_here"
```

## Running the App

To run the app in your local environment the command is `npm start`.
